        <p class="govuk-body">We also use essential cookies to remember your session and security settings.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Where you provide your consent, we use Microsoft Clarity cookies to collect information about how you use Get permission for marine work. This includes mouse movements, clicks, scrolling, and other interactions. This information helps us to improve our service.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can read full details about the cookies we use in the <a href="/help/cookies" class="govuk-link">cookies policy</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why we need it</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We use your information to:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>process marine licence applications</li>
          <li>publish the details of every application and licence on the public register, as required by law</li>
          <li>monitor compliance, including site visits after a licence is granted</li>
          <li>issue invoices and collect licence fees</li>
          <li>answer queries and manage complaints</li>
          <li>improve the service through analytics and user feedback</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you choose not to provide the information we ask for, we may be unable to accept your application, process your query or meet our legal duties.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Legal basis for processing</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We rely on four UK GDPR bases to process your personal data:</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Public task – Article 6(1)(e)</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">We run the Get permission for marine work service and keep the public register under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Legal obligation – Article 6(1)(c)</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">We must keep financial and audit records, such as licence invoices</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Legitimate interests – Article 6(1)(f)</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">We use anonymised analytics to improve the service and have checked that this does not override your rights and freedoms</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Consent – Article 6(1)(a)</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">We send optional alerts or newsletters only if you ask for them. You can withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect processing we carry out on other legal bases</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We do not use automated decision-making that has legal or similarly significant effects on you.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we do with your data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We will never sell or rent your information.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We share only what is necessary to deliver the service or where the law requires it:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>public register – your name, address and certain licence particulars appear online as required by law</li>
          <li>statutory consultees and advisors (for example CEFAS) – they receive the parts of an application needed to give technical advice</li>
          <li>other Defra group bodies or competent authorities – where another law or regulation requires us to share information</li>
          <li>Shared Services Connected Ltd (SSCL) – receives billing data so it can raise invoices</li>
          <li>authorised engineers may access data under strict support procedures</li>
          <li>aggregated, anonymised analytics may be processed by GOV.UK PaaS and Defra platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How long we keep your data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We keep personal data for seven years after the licence expires or a decision is made, whichever is later, unless a longer period is legally required (for example, ongoing litigation). After that it is securely deleted or anonymised in line with the MMO retention schedule.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Where your data is stored and processed</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Data is stored on UK-based cloud platforms operated for Defra:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS UK regions) – Common Data Platform (MongoDB)</li>
          <li>Microsoft Azure UK regions – Dataverse and Power Apps</li>
          <li>Defra Strategic Reporting Database (UK)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">No routine transfers are made outside the UK. If exceptional transfers are necessary, we will use UK-approved safeguards such as International Data Transfer Agreements.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How we protect your data</h2>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest</li>
          <li>role-based access controls and logging</li>
          <li>regular vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and audit</li>
          <li>supplier contractual clauses aligned to the UK GDPR and the Government Security Policy Framework</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Your rights</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You have the right to:</p>

          <li>erase your data in certain circumstances</li>
          <li>restrict or object to processing</li>
          <li>data portability (where applicable)</li>
          <li>not be subject to automated decisions with legal effect</li>
        </ul>
