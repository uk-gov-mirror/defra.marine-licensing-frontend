<p class="govuk-body">
  How accurate your eastings and northings coordinates are, depends on how many digits you use for each:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>2 + 2 digits (4 in total) - accurate to 1 square kilometre</li>
  <li>3 + 3 digits (6 in total) - accurate to 100 square metres</li>
  <li>4 + 4 digits (8 in total) - accurate to 10 square metres</li>
  <li>6 + 6 digits (12 in total) - accurate to 1 square metre</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Some places further north, such as the Shetland Islands, may need 7 digits for the northing coordinate.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Enter 2 values, each with at least 6 digits - one for eastings and one for northings. For example, 123456, 654321.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  Always enter eastings first, then northings, in their separate fields.
</p>

{% set introText %} 
  Eastings and northings should only include numbers. For example: 123456, 654321.
