## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v18` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd marine-licensing-frontend
nvm use
```

## Server-side Caching

We use Catbox for server-side caching. By default the service will use CatboxRedis when deployed and CatboxMemory for
local development.
You can override the default behaviour by setting the `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE` environment variable to either `redis` or
`memory`.

Please note: CatboxMemory (`memory`) is _not_ suitable for production use! The cache will not be shared between each
instance of the service and it will not persist between restarts.

## Redis

Redis is an in-memory key-value store. Every instance of a service has access to the same Redis key-value store similar
to how services might have a database (or MongoDB). All frontend services are given access to a namespaced prefixed that
matches the service name. e.g. `my-service` will have access to everything in Redis that is prefixed with `my-service`.

If your service does not require a session cache to be shared between instances or if you don't require Redis, you can
disable setting `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE=false` or changing the default value in `~/src/config/index.js`.

## Proxy

We are using forward-proxy which is set up by default. To make use of this: `import { fetch } from 'undici'` then because of the `setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl))` calls will use the ProxyAgent Dispatcher

If you are not using Wreck, Axios or Undici or a similar http that uses `Request`. Then you may have to provide the proxy dispatcher:

To add the dispatcher to your own client:

```javascript
import { ProxyAgent } from 'undici'

return await fetch(url, {
  dispatcher: new ProxyAgent({
    uri: proxyUrl,
    keepAliveTimeout: 10,
    keepAliveMaxTimeout: 10
  })
})
```

## Local Development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Code Analysis with Knip

We use [Knip](https://knip.dev/) to find and remove unused dependencies, exports, and files in the codebase. Knip helps keep projects clean by identifying dead code, unused dependencies, and unreferenced files.

To run knip:

```bash
npm run knip
```

Knip analyses the entire project and reports:

- Unused dependencies in `package.json`
- Unused exports that aren't imported anywhere
- Unreferenced files that aren't used
- Missing dependencies that should be added to `package.json`

Benefits of using knip:

- Reduces bundle sizes by identifying code that can be removed
- Improves build performance by eliminating unnecessary dependencies
- Makes the codebase easier to maintain and navigate
- Helps prevent version conflicts and security vulnerabilities from unused packages

For automatic fixes, knip can remove unused code with the `--fix` flag, though this should be used with caution and proper version control.

### Mutation Testing

We use [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) for mutation testing to assess the quality of our test suite by introducing small code changes (mutations) and verifying that tests catch them.

To run mutation testing:

```bash
npm run test:mutation
```

#### Configuration

The mutation testing is configured in `stryker.conf.cjs` with the following key settings:

**Files to mutate:**

- All JavaScript files in `src/` directory
- Excludes test files (`*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`)
- Excludes test helpers in `src/server/test-helpers/`
- Excludes problematic files that cause issues during mutation

**Test runner settings:**

- Uses Jest as the test runner with our existing `jest.config.js`
- Enables per-test coverage analysis for more precise mutation testing
- Disables `findRelatedTests` for better performance

**Output and reporting:**

- Generates HTML report in `reports/mutation/mutation.html`
- Provides clear-text and progress output during execution
- Runs with 4 concurrent workers for optimal performance

**Quality thresholds:**

- High threshold: 80% (good mutation score)
- Low threshold: 60% (minimum acceptable score)
- No break threshold (won't fail the build)

Reports help identify areas where test coverage could be improved by showing which mutations weren't caught by existing tests.

### Formatting

#### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## Docker

### Development image

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag marine-licensing-frontend:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 marine-licensing-frontend:development
```

### Production image

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag marine-licensing-frontend .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 marine-licensing-frontend
```

### Docker Compose

A local environment with:

- Localstack for AWS services (S3, SQS)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- This service.
- A commented out backend example.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Instructions for setting up SonarCloud can be found in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties).

## Releases

### [1.0.0](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/projects/ML/versions/23736/tab/release-report-all-issues)
